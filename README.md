For the purpose of the course, we will be using an open-source software stack that supports building dynamic web applications. Other specifications of the project and applications, including how to install, run and access the application, will be provided along with the final submission documents.

Introduction
An online bookstore is a web application that allows customers to buy books online. Customers can search for a book by title or author using a web browser, add it to their shopping cart, and then buy it using a credit card transaction. Due to the time limit of this project, not all functionalities of an online bookstore will be implemented. Instead, our application allows users to view lists of books, the details of the books, delete books, add comments about the books, and give ratings to the books.

How to run the application:
1. Execute "npm install" under CS628-team1 folder
2. run command "npm start" to start the express server for API
3. "cd Angular/bookstore"
4. "npm install" to insatll the node modules
5. ng serve to start the Angular application.
6. Open web browser to http://localhost:4200 and you can see the home page like below.
