# CS628-team1
Abstract
 
Throughout the span of this course, we will be building a fully functional web application. Specifically, the application is an online bookstore, where users can view lists of books, details of books, uploading new books or deleting certain books based on their access.
For the purpose of the course, we will be using an open-source software stack that supports building dynamic web applications. Other specifications of the project and applications, including how to install, run and access the application, will be provided along with the final submission documents.

An online bookstore is a web application that allows customers to buy books online. Customers can search for a book by title or author using a web browser, add it to their shopping cart, and then buy it using a credit card transaction. Due to the time limit of this project, not all functionalities of an online bookstore will be implemented. Instead, our application allows users to view lists of books, the details of the books, delete books, add comments about the books, and give ratings to the books.
